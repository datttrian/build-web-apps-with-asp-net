# Choose Your Own Adventure

In this project, you’ll use logic and conditional statements to write a
classic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game. Depending on what
choices your user makes, the program will have a different result. If
you’re interested in game development, this is a great project to get
your started! While we’re only working with text, the principles of user
input and control flow are used to build even highly advanced games.

We’ve provided you with a template to write a game, but we *highly
encourage* you to take what you’ve learned here and use your creativity
to write an original game, either here on Codecademy or off-platform!

## Set Up the Program

1.

Take a look at the program in the text editor. We use the command
`Console.Write()` to give instructions to the user, then
`Console.ReadLine()` to get input from the user. We save that input to a
variable named `name`. We can then interpolate the value of that
variable in a message we print to the console using
`Console.WriteLine()`.

We’ll be using these commands frequently throughout the project, so make
sure you’re comfortable with them before moving forward!




2.

Let’s start our story. Print the following sentences to the console:

```
It begins on a cold rainy night. You're sitting in your room and hear a noise coming from down the hall. Do you go investigate?
```




3.

So far, we’ve explained the story and asked our user to make a decision.
Let’s give our user some instructions for *how* to make a decision in
this game.

Use `Console.Write()` to inform the user that they should:

```
Type YES or NO: 
```




4.

Now we can use `Console.ReadLine()` to capture the user’s decision. Save
the user’s input to a `string` variable named `noiseChoice`.




5.

What if a user doesn’t type `YES`, but instead types `yes`? Modify the
`noiseChoice` variable so that it’s value is uppercase.




6.

It’s a good practice to save and run your code every few steps to make
sure there are no bugs. In the terminal, type the following command and
press <span class="kbd">Enter</span> on your keyboard:

``` bash
dotnet run
```




## Adding Conditional Statements

7.

We want our program to do something different based on a user’s
decision. If they type `YES`, then we want them to continue on in the
game and if they choose `NO`, we want the game to end.

Write an `if` statement that checks to see if a user writes `NO`. If the
user picks `NO`, then have the program print out:

```
Not much of an adventure if we don't leave our room!
THE END.
```

Use two `Console.WriteLine()` statements to break up the text.




8.

Write an `else if` statement that checks to see if a user writes `YES`.




9.

If the condition in the `else if` statement is true, have it print the
following text to the console:

```
You walk into the hallway and see a light coming from under a door down the hall.
You walk towards it. Do you open it or knock?
```




10.

Now it’s time for our user to make another decision. Let’s tell them
what they can type using `Console.Write()`:

```
Type OPEN or KNOCK:
```

Save their response to a variable named `doorChoice`. Make sure to
change the value of `doorChoice` to uppercase.




11.

Let’s write another conditional statement based on the user’s choice.
Write an `if` statement for if a user chooses `KNOCK` and an `else if`
statement for if they choose `OPEN`.




12.

In the `if` statement, have it print the following text to the console:

```
A voice behind the door speaks. It says, "Answer this riddle: "
"Poor people have it. Rich people need it. If you eat it you die. What is it?"
```




13.

Using `Console.Write()`, tell the user to answer the riddle:

```
Type your answer: 
```

Save their response to a variable named `riddleAnswer`.

14.

The correct answer to the riddle is `NOTHING`. So if a user types
`NOTHING`, the program will print the following to the screen:

```
The door opens and NOTHING is there.
You turn off the light and run back to your room and lock the door.
THE END.
```

If a user types anything else, the program will print the following to
the screen:

```
You answered incorrectly. The door doesn't open.
THE END.
```




## Adding a Switch Statement

15.

Return to the `else if` statement that checks to see if `doorChoice` is
equal to `OPEN`. If the condition is true, have it print the following
text to the console:

```
The door is locked! See if one of your three keys will open it.
```

16.

Using `Console.Write()`, get the user to give a number for the key they
want to use:

```
Enter a number (1-3):
```

Save their response to a `string` variable named `keyChoice`. Make sure
that the value of `keyChoice` is always uppercase!

17.

We’re going to use the value of the variable `keyChoice` for our switch
statement case. Write a switch statement that checks to see if a value
is equal to either `"1"`, `"2"`, or `"3"`.




18.

For each case, print out something to the console to finish the story.

If a user chooses `"1"`, print:

```
You choose the first key. Lucky choice!
The door opens and NOTHING is there. Strange...
THE END.
```

If a user chooses `"2"`, print:

```
You choose the second key. The door doesn't open.
THE END.
```

If a user chooses `"3"`, print:

```
You choose the third key. The door doesn't open.
THE END.
```




## Run the Program

19.

Let’s run the program! Save the program. Then, in the terminal, type the
following command and press <span class="kbd">Enter</span>:

```
dotnet run
```

Try different options. When you hit the end of the program, re-run it
and make a different decision than you did before. Keep doing that until
you’ve gone through all the possible endings to make sure your program
looks correct, no matter what options your user chooses.

If you are feeling ambitious, here are some extensions:

-   Modify the story and the code to create your very own Choose Your
    Adventure
-   Include more cases to check for other user input (what if a user
    picks a choice you didn’t include?)
-   Use ternary operators
